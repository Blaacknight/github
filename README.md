# GitBucket | Version Control Application

Welcome to **Apna GitHub Clone!** â€” a powerful, dual-purpose application that functions both as a **Git-like command-line tool** for version control and as a **full-featured backend server** for a GitHub-inspired web application.

This project allows you to:
- Initialize repositories
- Add, commit, and revert changes locally
- Push and pull commit history to/from an **AWS S3 bucket**
- Use robust APIs for **authentication**, **repository management**, and more ðŸš€

---

## Features

This project is split into **two main components**:

###  Command-Line Interface (CLI)

A fully functional version control system inspired by Git:

- `init` â€” Initialize a new, empty repository (`.apnagit`)
- `add <file>` â€” Stage a file for the next commit
- `commit <message>` â€” Save a snapshot of staged files
- `push` â€” Upload your entire commit history to a remote AWS S3 bucket
- `pull` â€” Download and restore commit history from S3
- `revert <commitID>` â€” Restore project files to the state of a specific commit

###  Backend API Server

A backend built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** to power a web application.

- **User Authentication:** Secure signup and login with **JWT**
- **Repository Management:** *(Coming Soon)* CRUD endpoints for repositories
- **Issue Tracking:** *(Coming Soon)* Create and manage issues per repository
- **Real-time Updates:** Integrated with **Socket.IO** *(future support)*
